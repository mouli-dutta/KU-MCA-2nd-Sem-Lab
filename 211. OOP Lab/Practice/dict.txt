A linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most
n comparisons, where n is the length of the list. If each element
is equally likely to be searched, then linear search has an average case of b
c comparisons, but the average case can be
affected if the search probabilities for each element vary. Linear
search is rarely practical because other search algorithms and
schemes, such as the binary search algorithm and hash tables,
allow significantly faster searching for all but short lists.
